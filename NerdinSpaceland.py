# Going into Chapter 1


print('I cracked his shield, he is low.')
print('Yeah I see him, good shot!')
print('Thanks.')
print('Time for dinner Kyle!')
print('I got to go guys.')
print('See ya!')
# Kyle walks to the dinner table and starts eating.
# Kyle's mother tells Kyle they are going to a themepark after dinner.
# Kyle gets done eating and goes upstairs to get ready.
# Kyle's family gets into the car.
print('Are you excited Kyle?')
print('Yeah! I have never been to this themepark.')
print('They have the setting set to the 1980s is what I have heard so far.')
# Kyle's family drives up to the themepark and goes to the ticket booth.
print('Can we get 4 tickets?')
print('Yes, that will be $50.')
# Kyle's mother gives the person at the ticket booth $50 US dollars.
# Kyle and his siblings go into the park.
print('Man, this is such a nice and wonderful themed park.')
# Kyle goes and does his rides at the themepark and decides to get ready to get off the ride.
print('Man, that was a good ride!')
# Kyle notices that he does not see his siblings nearby.
# Kyle goes and looks for his siblings, only to not find them in the whole themepark.
print('Hey, where is everybody at? I thought the themepark did not close until 6:30 PM.')
print('I better check the front entrance to see if my parents are waiting for me.')
# Kyle goes to the front entrance and see that the lock is twisted the right, symboling that the park is closed.
print('Why is the front entrance door locked?')
# Kyle goes behind the ticket booth and sees that there are no cars in the parking lot, not even his family's car.
print('What?! Where did my family go?!')
# Kyle sits down for a minute and thinks what just happened. 
print('This cannot be happening right now!')
# Kyle then looks around and see's a poster board that was not at the front entrance before.
# Kyle walks over to the poster board.
print('Was this poster board here? Wait, why does this say "Zombies in Spaceland Survial Park"')
# Kyle was breaking down the best scenario in his mind.
# Kyle then hears a low moan, Kyle thinks the low moan sounds like a zombie.
print('You have got to be kidding me! First I get abandonded, then I have to survive this themepark?!')
# Kyle is furious and see's a M1 Garand in the corner of the ticket booth. 
# Kyle thinks about grabbing the gun and trying to kill the zombie.
print('I doubt I can get a good shot, since I have never shot a gun before.')
# Kyle picks up the gun and walks outside the ticket booth.
print('The gig is over! Just show yourself!')
# Kyle thinks that the zombie is a person dressed up in a costume.
# Kyle puts the gun butt up under his arm pit and aims down the sights.
# Bam! Kyle shoots the M1 Garand. 
# Kyle then realizes that the zombie is not going down onto the floor.
print('Come on! That was a clear shot!')
# Kyle raises the gun up again and notices that there are no sockets in the zombies eyes.
# Kyle quickly realizes that the poster board was real and the zombie is real. 
# Kyle runs to a safe spot to think.
print('The best thing to do is supply power to the themepark, since the power mysteriously is down.')
# Kyle realizes that the zombie problem will only get worse.
print('Second objective, find components to find to make a make-shift sleeping bag or bed.')
# Kyle goes to the poster board and reads the instructions.
